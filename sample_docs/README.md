# Sample Documents

Place 1–3 small documents here for quick local testing.

Guidelines:
- Keep at least one tiny `.txt` file so judges can test quickly.
- You may also include a small PDF if your app supports PDF parsing.

For the challenge, you are encouraged to ingest open-access arXiv PDFs/HTML.
